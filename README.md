No idea at all how to continue writing a message? Or maybe you need a meaningless text for a prototype of your site? Perhaps you are attracted to too abstract humor? This model will help you in any of the above cases! Just enter the generation key, limit the amount of text and results, start writing what is needed, and the computer mind will help you.

## Getting started

Begin with opening the repo in console.

Continue with
